# Feature Spec: Manifest Storage Convention

## Overview
Establish a dedicated directory for manifest files and update the `scout` and `snap` commands to treat it as the default storage and lookup location.

## User Story
As a QA engineer, I want my manifest files to be stored in a centralized location so that they don't clutter my project root and are easy to reference by name.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Dedicated Directory**: All manifests generated by `scout` should be saved to `captures/manifests/` by default.
2. **Default Lookup**: When `paparazzit snap --manifest <name>` is called:
    - First, check if `<name>` exists at the provided path.
    - If not, check if it exists in `captures/manifests/<name>`.
3. **Automatic Creation**: Ensure the `captures/manifests/` directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist.

## Testing Requirements
1. **Scout Output**: Verify `scout` saves to the manifests folder by default.
2. **Snap Lookup**: Verify `snap` can find a manifest in the dedicated folder using only the filename.
3. **Compatibility**: Verify that providing a full relative or absolute path still works.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Running `paparazzit scout --url ...` creates `captures/manifests/manifest.json`.
- Running `paparazzit snap --manifest manifest.json` finds and processes the file from `captures/manifests/`.
